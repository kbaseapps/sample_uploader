The Cyanobacteria are one of the most metabolically and morphologically diverse bacterial phyla and it has been hypothesized that they are the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. The project proposed here would complement and utilize the genomic information that was generated during JGI’s GEBA Cyano project to add valuable insights about the metabolic processes that are active in members of this phylum and that have been - and still are - key factors in shaping our planet. In contrast to the GEBA Cyano project, the project proposed here include mixed cultures of organisms that are recalcitrant to separation. A com	Microbial	Unclassified	10.25585/1487758	Matthias Hess

The proposal will use metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of expressed bacterial genes to identify the genome-encoded, functional metabolic pathways actively used by DOC-degrading bacteria in permafrost soils and to determine how these pathways change when soil DOC is exposed to sunlight in surface waters. The proposal will then compare these results to DOC characterization by low and high-resolution mass spectrometry, and 13C-NMR of compounds that are produced or lost  during the exposure to light.

The proposal will use metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of expressed bacterial genes to identify the genome-encoded, functional metabolic pathways actively used by DOC-degrading bacteria in permafrost soils and to determine how these pathways change when soil DOC is exposed to sunlight in surface waters. The proposal will then compare these results to DOC characterization by low and high-resolution mass spectrometry, and 13C-NMR of compounds that are produced or lost  during the exposure to light. The proposal also aims to determine genes that are differentially expressed and DOC compounds that are differentially modified and respired following light exposure, compared to DOC kept in the dark.
